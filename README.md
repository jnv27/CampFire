# CampFire

##Overview :-

Let’s suppose a user is planning a vacation and he wants to go to some camping site to spend some time with his family or friends, so where will he find such a place? Bcz he can’t go just anywhere for camping, because chances are that place might not be safe due to some reasons.  So there should be some suitable application where he can look for online campgrounds which are available online, so that’s where my project CampFire comes into the picture, so It is basically a camping ground website, where a user can find camping sites and check their details like prices, area, location and it’s rating and reviews, and they can also leave their reviews and ratings on that particular campground if they have already visited it before. And even they can post their new camping sites as well which other users can rent.

##Special Features:- 

Apart from that I’ve also added a cluster map to this application, where it shows how many campgrounds are present in any area, let’s suppose if a user lives in California or somewhere in US, then the campgrounds which are in India are irrelevant for him, then he can just directly look into the cluster map that how many campgrounds are present in that particular area, and with a click he will be redirected to that campground’s show page where he will see more details about it.

I have also added user authentication to implement user authorization to this application, because if there won’t be any authorization then any other user will be able to change the crucial information of any campground, and will be even able to delete it.

##Technologies Used :-

Talking about the technologies which I used for this project was , so for the front-end I used Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS) as the front-end templating language for more DRY code compared to plain HTML and for dynamic user-experiences. I used Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework to keep the UI simple and quick to build. Since the website takes a performance hit for loading Bootstrap, I took full advantage of advanced Bootstrap features such as custom validation for all forms and animated form input for the login and register pages.

For the back-end I used Express.js as the Node.js application framework since it's a lightweight framework, which is ideal for gaining an understanding of how to build the backend from scratch.

I used PassportJs for authentication and authorization, bcz it is Extremely flexible and modular and it supports a comprehensive set of strategies using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and etc.

For the database I used NoSQL database MongoDB for the flexibility compared to a SQL database, and it is used very commonly with MERN or MEAN stacks. Also MongoDB in particular because of its prevalence in the industry. And it’s popular, it means it has a great community of strong developers so it becomes easy to seek for help when we are stuck somewhere.
